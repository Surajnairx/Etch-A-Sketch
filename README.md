# Etch-A-Sketch
This is a fun and interactive Etch A Sketch-style drawing app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic toy, this project allows users to draw by hovering or clicking across a grid of squares. It includes customizable features like grid size, color modes, and clearing the canvas.
